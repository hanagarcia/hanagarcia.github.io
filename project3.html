<p style="font-size:100%; background-color:lightgray">This 3d Scuplture was meant to make the viewer feel uneasy. Whether it be the spikes that seems to be coming at you, the chaotic unorganized style, or the skull stationed at the base of the "tree" it's meant to be unsettling. The process of making this sculpture was so interesting I had never really interacted with VR before this aside from 1am session playing BeatSaber in an Oculus with my friends. The thing that I had trouble with the most was just getting used to imagining something in a 3D sense and getting used to Meshmixer in general. I got this idea for uneasy by listening to a podcast and them mentioning sleep paralysis and how for some people see monsters. This idea fascinated me. A scary thing created from your mind. The things being described didn't even have to be scary they just caused the person suffering from sleep paralysis to feel uneasy and that's where my idea came from. </p>
