<p style="font-size:100%; background-color:lightgray">When making this picture collage my first thought was to incorporate both astrology and space with renaissance art. Both concepts fascinate me and I knew that combining the portraits and the statutes of the renaissance with the stars and planets would make an interesting pair. I choose to have the glitch look like a tv screen to make it seem as if this is “old news”. I also felt as if while making this I had to listen to Gustav Holst’s “The Planets Suite” which is collection of musical pieces that go through almost all of the solar system and give each planet an atmosphere musically.
The three renaissance women represent the plant or the moon in their area. The woman on the left is the moon the woman on the right is Jupiter and the woman in the middle is Mars. The statue represents humanity as it begins to rise into space. I wanted to make Mars the forefront due to how relevant it has become in modern culture.
ion behind this piece was personal, I tend to find artwork from these three styles/periods fascinating. I deeply appreciate the technique, the effort, the concept, the skill, and everything it took to make these pieces of art. Therefore, I wanted the audience to be able to still appreciate The Birth of Venus, so I created a contemporary piece that people nowadays can feel more comfortable seeing. They get the best of the old world with a mixture of the new world, they get to experience both at the same time. Augmented reality and the use of smartphones is also another great way for an audience to appreciate masterpieces nowadays, which my piece, The Rebirth of Venus encourages the audience to do.

My influence for this piece is not just Sandro Botticelli, in fact William-Adolphe Bouguereau and his interpretation of The Birth of Venus is an even greater influence to me. As a photographer who does portraiture and boudoir, paintings like these depicting Venus are an inspiration to me. The details, the realism, and the way they depict the female body are just phenomenal.</p>
